// const myTupple: (string | number | boolean)[] = [1, true, true]  // this is not tupple because i can set any type on any index of the array
var myTupple = [1, 'hello']; // in this example this is a pure tupple because the type and value and no of index pre defined this type declaration we call it tupples.
